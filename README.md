### Course Enrollment System for a university using TDD and CI techniques.

The team created a set of User Stories for a Course Enrollment System which can be seen in the Project Report linked down below. The goal of this assignment was to follow TDD and CI principles whilst developing the CES. Tests were written using JUnit and Mockito which can be seen in the commits that fail builds on TravisCI. The functionality for a feature was always written after writing the tests for it.<br/><hr>
